## ðŸ”¥ Introduction

Welcome to **Set AutoRegressive Modeling (SAR)**! We introduce a groundbreaking paradigm for AutoRegressive (AR) image generation that generalizes conventional AR to the next-set setting. Instead of outputting each token in a fixed raster order, SAR allows for the splitting of sequences into arbitrary sets containing multiple tokens. This novel approach opens up new possibilities for image generation.

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- **Generalized AR Framework**: Transition seamlessly from traditional AR to SAR, accommodating flexible sequence ordering.
- **Fully Masked Transformer**: Our straightforward architecture designed specifically for SAR.
- **Performance Insights**: Analyze the impact of sequence order and output intervals on model performance.
- **Photo-Realistic Image Synthesis**: Train a 900M text-to-image model capable of generating high-resolution images.

## âš¡ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.8+
- Necessary libraries (e.g., PyTorch, NumPy)

### Installation

To install **SAR**, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sar-project.git
